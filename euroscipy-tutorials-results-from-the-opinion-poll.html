            <h1>Euroscipy tutorials: results from the opinion poll</h1>

        <div><p>As the new tutorial chair for the next <a href="https://www.euroscipy.org/">Euroscipy
conference</a>, I was thinking this January
about the difficult choice of possible topics for advanced tutorials.
Euroscipy is the annual European conference on Scientific Python; it is
organized with two days of tutorials and two days of conference (keynotes
and contributed talks), with attendees from academia, industry and
start-ups.</p>
<p>While tutorials of the introduction track always covers a core of
packages and skills that are essential to beginners, advanced users have
enjoyed quite a large variety of topics during the <a href="https://www.euroscipy.org/2015/schedule/esp2015-tutorials/">advanced tutorial
track</a> of the
last conference editions. Attendees have various backgrounds and
expectations, from getting bleeding-edge news about the latest cool
packages to improving their numerical skills, learning about coding
best practices, or simply using core packages in a more efficient and
advanced way. How to find the right balance between topics answering
these different needs? A friend then suggested: hey, why not ask the
attendees themselves what they would like to learn during tutorials? </p>
<p>I quickly set up a list of potential topics, wrote a simple form, and
called for opinions on Twitter two months ago. I was lucky that this
message was retweeted enough, and that people seem to care about this
topic: the form got completed 71 times, which represents about half a
typical audience for the advanced tutorials of Euroscipy. Quite a good
score therefore! </p>
<p>The results of the poll (which is now closed) can be seen
<a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1H0vDPNgRVyESM1LYHSXXmunTgorNvVmu_psS56u9MOk/viewanalytics">here</a>.
Note that some topics were not included in the list, since they had been
presented the year before (like my favorite subject
<a href="http://scikit-image.org/">scikit-image</a>).</p>
<p>Since several outcomes of the poll were quite counter-intuitive to me,
I'm really glad I got so much feedback from an audience that I hope is
quite diverse -- of course there must be some bias due to the use of
Twitter for communication, but I still hope that the poll is a good proxy
for what people would like to see.</p>
<p>A few lessons from this poll</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>advanced tutorials on core packages or skills, such as advanced NumPy,
  Python, and scientific plotting, all score very high. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>software development methods (how to turn your bunch of scripts into an
efficient and reliable package that you can share with others) also
look quite popular, as shown by the high scores of Testing, Packaging and
Parallel computing. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>machine-learning-related topics, such as scikit-learn or neural
  nets/deep learning, were popular as well.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>version control did not seem a priority to poll respondents -- let's
  hope it means that most scientists now master version control (although
this would somewhat contradict my experience!).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>unsurprisingly, topics that are slightly more specialized, such as
  natural language processing or linear algebra, were not as popular as
less specialized subjects. I might pick one or two of these topics that
are of high interest to a fraction of the audience, to beat the tyranny
of the majority (of course, a poll is meant to obtain what the majority
thinks!).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So, what's next? Now I will be looking for speakers for the most popular
topics revealed by the poll, plus a couple of others for which I'll claim a
wild card privilege as tutorial chair :-). After looking at the poll
results, if you feel like giving a tutorial at Euroscipy 2016 (Erlangen,
Germany, August 23-27), please contact me, preferably by e-mail
(firtsname.lastname@nsup.org). There should also be a more official call
for talks and tutorials on the Euroscipy website in a couple of
days/weeks.</p>
<p>If you feel like commenting on the results of the opinion poll, please
leave a comment on this blog post. I would like to finish with a big
thank you to all the people who took the time to complete the opinion
poll: it really helped!  </p></div>
