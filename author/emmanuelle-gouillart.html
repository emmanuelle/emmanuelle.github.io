        </div>
        
        <div><p>As the new tutorial chair for the next <a href="https://www.euroscipy.org/">Euroscipy
conference</a>, I was thinking this January
about the difficult choice of possible topics for advanced tutorials.
Euroscipy is the annual European conference on Scientific Python; it is
organized with two days of tutorials and two days of conference (keynotes
and contributed talks), with attendees from academia, industry and
start-ups.</p>
<p>While tutorials of the introduction track always covers a core of
packages and skills that are essential to beginners, advanced users have
enjoyed quite a large variety of topics during the <a href="https://www.euroscipy.org/2015/schedule/esp2015-tutorials/">advanced tutorial
track</a> of the
last conference editions. Attendees have various backgrounds and
expectations, from getting bleeding-edge news about the latest cool
packages to improving their numerical skills, learning about coding
best practices, or simply using core packages in a more efficient and
advanced way. How to find the right balance between topics answering
these different needs? A friend then suggested: hey, why not ask the
attendees themselves what they would like to learn during tutorials? </p>
<p>I quickly set up a list of potential topics, wrote a simple form, and
called for opinions on Twitter two months ago. I was lucky that this
message was retweeted enough, and that people seem to care about this
topic: the form got completed 71 times, which represents about half a
typical audience for the advanced tutorials of Euroscipy. Quite a good
score therefore! </p>
<p>The results of the poll (which is now closed) can be seen
<a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1H0vDPNgRVyESM1LYHSXXmunTgorNvVmu_psS56u9MOk/viewanalytics">here</a>.
Note that some topics were not included in the list, since they had been
presented the year before (like my favorite subject
<a href="http://scikit-image.org/">scikit-image</a>).</p>
<p>Since several outcomes of the poll were quite counter-intuitive to me,
I'm really glad I got so much feedback from an audience that I hope is
quite diverse -- of course there must be some bias due to the use of
Twitter for communication, but I still hope that the poll is a good proxy
for what people would like to see.</p>
<p>A few lessons from this poll</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>advanced tutorials on core packages or skills, such as advanced NumPy,
  Python, and scientific plotting, all score very high. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>software development methods (how to turn your bunch of scripts into an
efficient and reliable package that you can share with others) also
look quite popular, as shown by the high scores of Testing, Packaging and
Parallel computing. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>machine-learning-related topics, such as scikit-learn or neural
  nets/deep learning, were popular as well.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>version control did not seem a priority to poll respondents -- let's
  hope it means that most scientists now master version control (although
this would somewhat contradict my experience!).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>unsurprisingly, topics that are slightly more specialized, such as
  natural language processing or linear algebra, were not as popular as
less specialized subjects. I might pick one or two of these topics that
are of high interest to a fraction of the audience, to beat the tyranny
of the majority (of course, a poll is meant to obtain what the majority
thinks!).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So, what's next? Now I will be looking for speakers for the most popular
topics revealed by the poll, plus a couple of others for which I'll claim a
wild card privilege as tutorial chair :-). After looking at the poll
results, if you feel like giving a tutorial at Euroscipy 2016 (Erlangen,
Germany, August 23-27), please contact me, preferably by e-mail
(firtsname.lastname@nsup.org). There should also be a more official call
for talks and tutorials on the Euroscipy website in a couple of
days/weeks.</p>
<p>If you feel like commenting on the results of the opinion poll, please
leave a comment on this blog post. I would like to finish with a big
thank you to all the people who took the time to complete the opinion
poll: it really helped!  </p></div>

        <div class="summary"><p>A colleague recently asked me for tips for the documentation of his new
in-house Python project. Dozens of webpages explain
<a href="http://docs.writethedocs.org/writing/beginners-guide-to-docs/">why</a> and
<a href="http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/writing/documentation/">how to</a>
write documentation, including for Python packages. Nevertheless,
scientific projects have some specificities, so I thought it could be
worth sharing here some points that we discussed together. Don't think
that these tips only apply to "big projects": as long as you expect other
people than yourself to use the code (or to develop it), good
documentation can be a game-changer no matter the scale of the project.</p>
<p>A first and counter-intuitive point is that <strong>code matters as much as "real
documentation"</strong>. A <a href="http://hintjens.com/blog:94">clear, concise and well-thought
API</a> will make your users love your project
much more that pages of explanations attempting to make up for a
cluttered or clumsy API. As for developers, short functions, or variable
names used consistently over the package, are more efficient …</p> <a class="btn btn-info xsmall" href="http://emmanuelle.github.io/tools-and-tips-for-documenting-scientific-python-projects.html">read more</a></div>

        <div class="summary"><p>Image processing is used for a variety of applications, from the
segmentation of organs in medical imaging to the detection of objects in
astrophysics. At least, that's what we say to introduce the applications
of image processing during presentations on
<a href="http://scikit-image.org/">scikit-image</a>, such as today's tutorial at
<a href="https://www.euroscipy.org/2015/schedule/presentation/70/">Euroscipy
2015</a>. For such
tutorials, we select applications that we think are typical of broad
interest, such as the segmentation of objects. But let's face it, it is
all too easy to mix up what is typical and of broad /generalinterest, and
what is the kind of problems that ones encounters in his/her own work.</p>
<p>Therefore, I would love to hear more about typical problems that
people wish to solve using image processing. If you're using image
processing, please leave a comment on this post, including:</p>

<li>a few words about the field and the application</li>

<h1 id="Segmentation-of-low-contrast-touching-objects">Segmentation of low-contrast touching objects<a class="anchor-link" href="#Segmentation-of-low-contrast-touching-objects">&#182;</a></h1><p>This tutorial explains how to segment an image composed of similar-looking objects connected by low-contrast boundaries, using <code>scikit-image</code> as well as other modules of the Scientific Python stack.</p>
<p><img src="images/grains_crop.png" width="250" align="left">
<img src="images/grains_automatic_segmentation.png" width="250"></p>
<p>I started working on this example when a colleague told me that his team had trouble with the segmentation. I first thought that obtaining a good segmentation would be straightforward, since the eye detects very well structures such as the grains of interest here. It turned out that I had been way too optimistic, since the low contrast between edges and grains prohibited using simple methods, such as edge detection with Canny filter.</p>
<p>If you have other ideas on how to perform a good segmentation in a reasonable time, please share your thoughts, for example on Twitter (@EGouillart).</p>
<p>If you're just getting started with image processing, you're very welcome to peruse through this tutorial, but it might not be the best place to start learning about image segmentation. Indeed, basic concepts of image processing are not explained in details.

Euroscipy 2015 is the 8th edition of the conference, with previous
editions taking place in Leipzig, Paris and Brussels.</p>
<p>Euroscipy includes two days of
<a href="https://www.euroscipy.org/2015/schedule/esp2015-tutorials/">tutorials</a>
(August 26-27), which are incredibly good value: for 50 or 100 GBP
(academic/student or regular price), you will take part in hands-on
tutorials given by teachers with a proficient knowledge of the Scientific
Python ecosystem. Tutorial speakers are often developers of the main
scientific python packages on top of being seasoned users of the
ecosystem. They give these tutorials for free, because they believe that
Euroscipy is an efficient way to train a large number of people in one
event. In comparison, companies rightly charge several thousands of euros
for multi-day …</p> <a class="btn btn-info xsmall" href="http://emmanuelle.github.io/first.html">read more</a></div>
