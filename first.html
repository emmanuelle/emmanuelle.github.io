        <div><p>Early-bird registration for the <a href="https://www.euroscipy.org/2015/">Euroscipy
conference</a> ends this Tuesday (July
7th): did you register already? The annual European conference on
Scientific Python will take place in Cambridge UK, from August 26 to 29.
Euroscipy 2015 is the 8th edition of the conference, with previous
editions taking place in Leipzig, Paris and Brussels.</p>
<p>Euroscipy includes two days of
<a href="https://www.euroscipy.org/2015/schedule/esp2015-tutorials/">tutorials</a>
(August 26-27), which are incredibly good value: for 50 or 100 GBP
(academic/student or regular price), you will take part in hands-on
tutorials given by teachers with a proficient knowledge of the Scientific
Python ecosystem. Tutorial speakers are often developers of the main
scientific python packages on top of being seasoned users of the
ecosystem. They give these tutorials for free, because they believe that
Euroscipy is an efficient way to train a large number of people in one
event. In comparison, companies rightly charge several thousands of euros
for multi-day trainings in scientific Python. Disclaimer: obviously,
training given during the tutorials cannot be as personalized as
trainings focusing on small groups, so I'm not saying that people should
attend tutorials only instead of on-demand professional training! Go for
the on-demand training if your lab/company can afford it, of course.</p>

<p>Skills in scientific computing become more and more valuable in public
labs and companies, with the ever-increasing volume and variety of
scientific data and the explosion of the data-based digital economy. Yet
the number of science and engineering students getting proper academic
training in scientific computing is still astonishingly low. Therefore,
most scientists use self-taught scientific computing skills. The
simplicity of the Python language might lure many into thinking that
they master programming well enough, but using NumPy efficiently, for
example, requires some effort. It happens to me quite often that a
colleague from the lab shows me a piece of Python code he or she's
struggling with, and that classical NumPy machinery such as masking with
a boolean array, or rolling over array axes, makes it trivial. Trainings
such as Euroscipy's tutorials can therefore boost your learning curve, by
being introduced to a consistent set of good practices and having the
opportunity to test these new skills thanks to hands-on exercises. I'm
therefore convinced that there is a large pool of students, researchers
in universities or company employees, that can benefit greatly from
attending Euroscipy's tutorials. Nowadays, good scientific computing
skills can contribute significantly to the performance of a lab or a
company, and trying to improve the average computing skill level should
be among the top priorities of every scientific group leader.</p>
<p>More advanced users will also have exciting subjects to get their teeth
into, with an advanced tutorial track that includes a thorough Cython
tutorial, statistics in Python, or a tutorial on image processing
scikit-image given by Juan Nunez-Iglesias and yours truly. For users
that master well the core of Python and NumPy, two possible areas of
improvement are usually 1) better programming skills (for example using
good practices such as testing and version control or mastering simple
optimization strategies such as advanced NumPy or Cython) and 2) and
better knowledge of scientific computing, both on the algorithmic and
implementation side. I always learn a lot on the two sides when attending
Euroscipy tutorials.</p>
<p>Besides the quality of the training delivered at Euroscipy, another bonus
of the conference is the interaction with other participants. Euroscipy's
audience is a crowd of enthusiastic and skilled people, coming from
diverse fields. You can actually learn almost as much from chatting with
people about your experience, best practices (and frustrations), as from
tutorials and talks. Social events provide a great opportunity for
chatting and networking, in a relaxed and friendly atmosphere. I
appreciate very much the mixed crowd of people from academic labs,
start-ups and industry, which is quite unique among the conferences I
attend. Students can improve their job perspectives by meeting future
employers, and by realizing which areas of science and industry hire
people with scientific computing skills. My only regret is that the
gender ratio is not balanced enough, but women will feel comfortable in a
crowd that is welcoming, friendly and respectful. It is my hope that more
and more female scientists will come to Euroscipy to become power-users
of scientific Python.</p>
<p>Finally, if you can't make it this year to Euroscipy, you can still
benefit from the <a href="http://scipy-lectures.github.io/">SciPy lecture notes</a>,
a large set of tutorials that were realized for previous Euroscipy
conferences. The SciPy lecture notes are a comprehensive set of
tutorials, starting from the core of Scientific Python (mastering the
Python language and NumPy) to more advanced topics (advanced NumPy,
optimizing code) and specialized packages (scikit-learn, scikit-image).
When a new person in the lab wishes to start learning Python for science,
I usually direct her to the Scipy lecture notes to get started.</p>
<p>Hope to see you at Euroscipy 2015!</p></div>
